The purpose of this application is to complete homework assignment 1 for CEG 4110. The app uses two different activites representing part one and part two of the assignment. 

## Usage
#### Part 1

The first part of the assignment is to create a single UI screen having one text field, and one button. A user can type into this text field and their typed text will be displayed in the field. The function of the button is to randomize the color of the text in the field. I have labled this button "CHANGE COLOR". When this button is pressed, a lable beneath the button beomes visible and displayes the random color both as rgb values and as a hex color value.

This part of the application is the main activity. The activity can be changed by clicking the button labled "TOGGLE ACTIVITY".

#### Part 2

The second part of the application is a drawing panel. Here, the user can draw on the screen and lines will be created where the user drags their finger. The user can move back to the first activity by activating the back button on their mobile device. Going back to the first activity will also clear their drawing.
